HASHWallet internally uses 24 words as in BIP39 and a PassPhrase stored on your phone, but all of this is transparent for you. You only need to know your email and your phone number.

Why do we use words if you do not need them? To be compatible with other manufacturers. This way, you can forget that mesh and come with us.
