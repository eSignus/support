If you want heirs for your crypto funds, you must give them a duplicate Card. The next step is for your heirs to get access to your phone line as access to their inheritance.

They can not use the Link Card before its initialization, so they will need access to your email (which you might not have given anyone) or phone line. This way, they will only have access to the crypto funds after your death.
