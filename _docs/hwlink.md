### Agility in its use

HASHWallet executes orders from the HW Manager. We have designed an App to be simple. Therefore, it is precisely the same as operating with a soft wallet or even with an exchange. The only difference is that the transaction signature is done on the card.

### Simplicity in its recovery and in its inheritance

In the Security & Backup section, we can review the recovery process. It was designed to eliminate stress, including responsibility, in said recovery, maintaining absolute security against attacks and preventing the user from being a victim of phishing.

But how do we facilitate an inheritance? Since the recovery system has two parts: 

- One that contains the Recovery Seed (maintained by the Issuer of the card). We will give a card duplicate to our(s) heir(s).
- Another that has the Recovery Key (maintained by the Vault manager). To retreive this second part a user needs to have access to the email account or the phone number. We can leave the phone number to our heirs as part of the inheritance. The funds can only be accessed if we pass away.

### Safety forever

HASHWallet Link is a dumb device. Its only ability is to execute orders signed by eSignus. Simple orders. Any operation is designed as a list of instructions executed sequentially. Nobody can order anything else to our LINK card and always from our HW Manager who has the PassPhrase, without which the correct keys would not be derived. Thus, adding new currencies or functionalities can be done by adding new scripts (not new commands), but let's remember once again that these sequences must be signed by eSignus to be executed.
