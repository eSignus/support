As we have seen in the previous paragraph, we have mainly two options to start asset management:

- Choose the type of transaction from the portfolio view, then select the wallet.
- Choose the wallet from the portfolio view, then select the transaction.

Now you need to define the transaction. These are the present options:

- Send. In this case, you will need to scan, copy or write down the destination address (picture). At this moment, the button ADD AMOUNT goes to green. Press it (picture). You can select an automatic amount (all, half, or a quarter of the total funds in the wallet) or write the amount you want to transfer. If this amount fits in wallet funds, the button CONTINUE goes green, and you can press it (picture). The next step shows you a summary of the transaction. If you agree, press the green button (ACCEPT WITH LINK), and finally, place your card close to the phone and hold it (picture) till the HW Manager asks you to do so. (picture)
  Receive. This option will show you the wallet's public address. You can hold it, so the sender scans it, copy it to the clipboard to include it in a message, or share it directly. (picture)
- Buy. This will redirect you to the exchanges that allow buying from HASHWallet. This list is constantly increasing. Each partner behaves differently.
- Swap. This will redirect you to the exchanges that allow swapping from HASHWallet. This list is constantly increasing. Each partner behaves differently.

We have added a historical graph for each wallet (this does not apply to the testnet wallets). You can see a icon in the upper right corner, just to the left of the three points icon. If you press it, you will see the evolution of the portfolio value (in the FIAT coin configured).

Another way to see all your wallets, even those hidden, is to press over Assets on the bottom line. Here if you slide any wallet.

- To the right, you will go to the send page
- To the left, you will go to the receive page

As you can also see the hidden wallets, this is a perfect way if you want to make them visible again.
