The Issuer is the entity that has contact with the final customer, so they have sold the Link to you.

The Issuer is the contact point for anything related to your Card, but they "only" commercialize it. They maintain the relationship between the user and the Customizer.

Very important, the Issuer neither knows nor has access to the pre-initialization data.
