**HW Link card** is the fusion of a soft wallet (its capability to use it as software) and a cold wallet because your keys are stored offline, and nobody can hack it externally. Moreover, with HW Link, phishing is not feasible. You can not tell anyone your recovery words if you do not know them. Finally, the most impressive achievement is that you do not need to worry about losing your device or the recovery system. You, and only you, can always recover your keys.

So, let's repeat it in case you feel something is not possible. Inside the HASHWallet ecosystem, you operate as easy as a soft wallet, with the security of a cold wallet. Nobody can steal your keys, but you can always recover them. Yes, this is incredible but true.
Simple, the magic is inside.

## How to use the HW Link card

Download HW Manager from App Store or Google Play. Once you have installed the App, you must register to unlock and access the eSignus Backup Center.

## How to add your HW Link card to the HW Manager App.

Once the application is installed, to add a card, you need to register. After the registration process in the eSignus Backup Center, you will be able to scan a card to add it to the HW Manager.
- Tapping on the card that is reflected empty in the Portfolio view.
- From "Settings" tapping on "Scan card."

The adding process is different if the card is already initialized or not.

### New card

A new card must initialize and generate the master seed during the process. This master seed is randomly generated inside the Secure Element and will never leave the card. With this process, you can recover your card if needed, but nobody else can. This process is detailed in [Scanning your first HASHWallet LINK](/docs/scanning/)

### Already initialized card

After selecting the SCAN CARD button, you need to place your card close to the phone and hold it until the HW Manager indicates it to you. We will need to repeat the process to receive the previous backup from the eSignus Backup Center. You have added your card, and all the information is on the HW Manager.
