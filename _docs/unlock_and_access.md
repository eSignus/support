You have already registered in the Issuer and the eSignus Backup Center. If this is not true, please visit Setup eSignus Backup Center.

To unlock the HW Manager, you have two options:

- Biometric authentication, in this case, the App will open automatically with biometry.
- Non-biometric authentication, if you have not habilitated the biometric authentication, you will need to log in using **passwordless access**. You can select email or SMS authentication. You will receive a One Time Password through your chosen method to log in.
