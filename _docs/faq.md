## What happens if I lose my HASHWallet?

No problem, ask for a duplicate from your Issuer. You can find this option directly from the front page. Press over the three pints icon over the representation of your Link Card, and voila, here you have a shortcut to request your duplicate. The Manager will redirect you to the Issuer (after login), and it's done.

## What happens if I change or reset my phone?

As easy as installing a new Manager App on your new phone. Once installed, identify yourself with your email or phone number, and your Manager is back. Now add your Link Cards. It is no more than 5 minutes.

## Supported coins?

The list of supported coins is in Currencies already included, but we have new ones continuously.

## 24/25 words?

HASHWallet internally uses 24 words as in BIP39 and a PassPhrase stored on your phone, but all of this is transparent for you. You only need to know your email and your phone number.

Why do we use words if you do not need them? To be compatible with other manufacturers. This way, you can forget that mesh and come with us.

## What will happen when I die?

If you want heirs for your crypto funds, you must give them a duplicate Card. The next step is for your heirs to get access to your phone line as access to their inheritance.

They can not use the Link Card before its initialization, so they will need access to your email (which you might not have given anyone) or phone line. This way, they will only have access to the crypto funds after your death.

## Which crypto can I buy in HW Manager?

Initially, you can buy the next ones:

BTC, ETH, BNB, XLM, SOL, AVAX, DOGE, MATIC (on polygon), LTC, RVN, BCH, DGB, ARDR, IGNIS, XRP, ATOM, TRX, KLAY, USDT, USDC, LINK, UNI, CAKE.

## How To Update Your Email Address For Your eSignus Account?

Go to Settings->Backup center. Click over your email address, and you can change it. Do this only if you have your HW Link Card (if you have several, any of them will suffice) to confirm the operation.

## How to update your phone number on the eSignus Account?

Go to Settings->Backup center. Click over your phone number, and you can change it. Do this only if you have your Link Card (if you have several, any of them will suffice) to confirm the operation.
