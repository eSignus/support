A secure element (the first version uses the SLE78) certified EAL6+. In this secure element (or its successors) there is a library that allows access to a set of cryptographic functions. Nothing more. This simplicity gives it flexibility and robustness.

An NFC antenna, which, as it is short-range, prevents sniffing.
