This company's role is to receive the orders from the Issuer (new and duplicated Cards) and pre-initialize cards with random values (new Cards) generated by an isolated HSM and cards with stored values (duplicated Cards). The Customizer has no access to the values stored in the Cards. Those random values are stored (encrypted) in an isolated database.
The customizing process happens in infrastructure without communication with the internet. The Cards enter into the infrastructure physically and leave pre-personalized.
