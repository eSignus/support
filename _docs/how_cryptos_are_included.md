As you have indeed read previously, HASHWallet Link is a dumb device. It only executes orders from the Manager.

To generate new lists of orders resulting in the signature of new coins, we use HOLa, which stands for HASHWallet Operations Language.

Amazingly, we do not need to change the Operating System or charge new algorithms inside Link. We only send Link a new set of operations.

How can we be sure no malware operations execute into Link? Link only accepts signed functions with the eSignus private key. Easy.
