title: What is a hardware wallet?

We can find definitions in many places, but in summary, we can say that it is a store of our wallets' private and public keys. We can seven say that a paper wallet, where we write down our keys, is a hardware wallet, the most primitive.

### What do we want from a Hardware wallet?

From our point of view (with this objective, we created HASHWallet), it must be agile, allowing us to use it in the most similar way to a softwallet. But it also has to solve the problems that do not appear every day, such as, for example: 

- Being able to recover it if for any reason we have lost access 
- Allow our loved ones to access the funds in the event of death without allowing them to access them while we are alive. 

This is in its usability aspect, but it must also be robust and reliable, ensuring that evolutions in its functionality cannot create security holes that did not exist at the beginning. The more complex a system is, the more likely it is to have such holes. This is why we designed HASHWallet so that it cannot be updated. In this way, a code audit will be valid forever.
In summary, we ask for a hardware wallet:

- Agility in its use
- Simplicity in its recovery and in its inheritance
- Safety forever
