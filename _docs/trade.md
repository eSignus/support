It is available from the bottom line of the front page and allows us access to three options:

- Market. If we select this option, we will see the list of all assets sorted by market cap. Please select any of them, and an information page will show you the asset's value and evolution. (picture)
- Buy. The Manager will redirect you to a third party. Remember you need to copy the final destination of the funds to use during the buying process.
- Swap. Nowadays, eSignus is using Changelly to swap coins. When you enter the swapping process, you will enter this formulary (picture). Fill it out, review it, and if you agree, you will need to sign the operation with your LINK Card.
